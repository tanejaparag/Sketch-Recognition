# Sketch-Recognition

This project aims at recognizing sloppy sketches using deep learning convolutional model. After
recognizing the sketch, it fetches the learning content for the targeted audience using Google Search API.
The dataset for the sketches is collected for around 250 objects from Tu Berlin. Implementing theoretical
knowledge gained in classes such as Learning Agents, Supervised Machine Learning, etc. into a real-time
application. A kidâ€™s sloppy sketches can be made into a fun learning activity which will help to educate the
child through visual content. And this could be a great idea to keep children away from cartoons.
